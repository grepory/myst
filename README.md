An API for muxing analytics data. Broadcasts events, user updates, page views, and the like to multiple channels: Google Analytics, Intercom, and Launch Darkly.

### API
The API is well documented in [server.js](https://github.com/opsee/analytics/blob/HEAD/server.js). 

### Local development
You can start the devserver with `npm run start` (or `nodemon server.js`). Run tests with `npm run test`, which includes linting. 

#### Environment variables
This service uses a few environment variables for secrets, which can be a pain
for local development. Instead, it's recommended to create a local config file.
Mappings from environment variable name to config key can be found in
`config/custom-environment-variables.json` -- these are the things you'll likely
want to add to your local config.

By default, `config/local.json` is ignored by git and safe for holding secrets -- if you name yours something
else, please make sure it doesn't get commited!

### Deployment
Deployment is done via the [`compute`](github.com/opsee/compute) repo: `./run deploy production analytics`.

To build the image locally, use `npm run docker-build`. To run it locally, use `npm run docker-run`. To manually build and publish the Docker image to [quay.io](https://quay.io/repository/opsee/analytics), use `npm run docker-publish`.
